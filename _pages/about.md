I am **Yuqin Zhang**, a Bachelor’s degree candidate in Food Science and Technology at the University of California, Davis, with a minor in Statistics. My research interests lie in the areas of food microbiology, microbial genomics, and food safety. I have been recognized for my academic excellence and research contributions, including the Dean’s Honor List and the Provost's Undergraduate Research Fellowship. My work focuses on improving food safety and quality through innovative techniques and technologies. Alongside my research, I am actively involved in professional associations and various extracurricular activities.

## Research Projects:

1. **Novel Renewable Bactericidal Wax Supplement for Control of Foodborne Pathogens on Fresh Produce**
   - Investigated the development of a new eco-friendly bactericidal wax for fresh produce to improve food safety by effectively controlling foodborne pathogens. Conducted bacterial inoculation and monitored the populational change of *Listeria monocytogenes* on citrus fruits using plate count methods.
   
2. **Survival of *Listeria monocytogenes* on Commercial Gourmet Mushrooms during Preharvest Cultivation and Postharvest Storage**
   - Examined the survival rates of *Listeria monocytogenes* on different types of gourmet mushrooms, contributing to sample inoculation, bacteria enumeration, and data analysis to enhance food safety practices in the mushroom industry.
   
3. **Fate of Foodborne Pathogens on Lemons after Lab- and Pilot-Scale Finishing Wax Application**
   - Assessed the effectiveness of different finishing waxes and drying temperatures on reducing pathogens on citrus fruits, providing critical data to inform food safety protocols in packinghouses. Prepared selective agar and maintained the storage environment for post-treatment observation.
   
4. **Systematic and Integrated Approach to Mitigation of Antimicrobial Resistance in Aquaculture**
   - Investigated the impact of antibiotic use on the abundance and diversity of antimicrobial resistance bacteria and genes in catfish and rearing water. Supported project supplies, media preparation, and regular measurement of environmental parameters.
